Movie Recommendation system using Boltzmann Machine

Why Boltzmann Machine ?

Ans : It is a stochastic of generative deep learning model. The training data fed to the system adjust itself from the hidden layer interconnected with each other.When we are talking about implementing Boltzmann machine, we are actually talking about Restricted Boltzmann machine where the visible nodes are not interconnectd and hidden layers are not interconnected. Through training the RBM will learn to allocate the hidden neurons as certain features. Then it will understand the importance of the features and then update the input lyer weights.
